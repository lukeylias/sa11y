            <p>
              Web accessibility refers to the ability of people with
              disabilities, such as visual, auditory, physical, speech or
              cognitive, to access and interact with web content. It ensures
              equal access to information and services, enabling everyone to
              participate fully in the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve web accessibility, the

                ><i class="material-icons">open_in_new</i>
              </a>

              provide a set of instructions for building websites that everyone
              can use, including people with disabilities. These guidelines are
              created and maintained by experts in the industry and individuals
              with lived experience.
            </p>
            <p>The <strong>WCAG</strong> is based on four main principles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Perceivable</li>
              <li>Operable</li>
              <li>Understandable</li>
              <li>Robust</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There are then 13 guidelines associated with testable success
              criteria for each principle, which are further divided into three
              levels of conformance, namely levels A, AA, and AAA.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't worry - we won't dive into
              the details too much. You don't need any prior knowledge to get
              started identifying accessibility issues.

            <h2>Images</h2>
            <p>
              Ensuring images have descriptive text, also known as alt text, is
              crucial for web accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alt text provides a textual alternative to the content of an
              image, allowing users who are blind or visually impaired to
              understand the image's meaning using screen readers or other
              assistive technologies. It also helps with SEO "Search Engine
              Optimization" and improves the overall accessibility of your
              website for all users.

              <li>Run the aXe extension.</li>
              <li>
                Check for any issues refering to <strong>Alt text</strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Right-click</strong> on the image you want to check,
                select <strong>inspect</strong> or
                <strong>inspect element</strong> (depending on the browser)
              </li>
              <li>
                While hovering over the image with your cursor, you will get a
                preview which will show whether or not the image has alt text.

            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Images that convey information unavailable through other content
                should have an alt tag. <br /><strong>Meaningful: </strong
                ><code>Alt="What gets read goes here"</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Images that provide no information, such as illustrations, must
                be coded as decorative. <br /><strong>Decorative: </strong
                ><code>Alt=""</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                The rule of thumb used to determine whether an image is
                informative is to remove it from the screen: if I am missing
                information because the image is gone, then it means the image
                is informative and needs alt text.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check any images with alt text are descriptive and relevant.
                This requires some manual intervention, but we want to ensure
                alt text is accurate.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's run through an example below.</p>
            <aside class="responsive-image">
              <img
                src="assets/CathyFreeman_5.jpeg"
                alt="Cathy Freeman in action at the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
                wearing her iconic green and gold body suit and white cap,
                dominating the track event with fierce competition in the
                backdrop."
              />

              </div>
              <div class="caption-text">
                When writing alternative text (alt text), it is important to
                take into consideration the image's context and purpose, rather
                than just describing its contents. For instance, in the image
                above, stating that it shows a group of marathon runners would
                be accurate, but it may also be important to include additional
                context such as Cathy Freeman's victory, representing Australia
                at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.
              </div>
            </div>

            <strong>Good alt text: </strong>
            <p>
              <code>
                alt="Cathy Freeman in action at the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
                wearing her iconic green and gold body suit and white cap,
                dominating the track event with fierce competition in the
                backdrop."</code

            <strong>Accurate alt text: </strong>
            <p><code>alt="A group of marathon runners."</code></p>
            <strong>Bad alt text: </strong>

              logical structure, with proper nesting (H1, H2, H3, etc.), is
              essential for accessibility.

              Users who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers,
              navigate web pages primarily using headings. A logical heading
              structure allows them to efficiently grasp the page's content and
              organisation.

              Colour contrast refers to the difference in brightness between two
              colours. Sufficient color contrast is essential for ensuring the
              readability of text and other visual elements on your website.
              Users with low vision or colour blindness may struggle to read
              text with poor colour contrast, making it crucial to verify that
              your website meets the recommended contrast ratios.

            <h2>Navigation</h2>
            <p>
              Keyboard navigation allows users to interact with web elements
              using the keyboard instead of a mouse. This is essential for users
              with motor impairments or who use screen readers, as they rely
              solely on the keyboard to navigate and interact with websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Testing keyboard navigation ensures that all interactive elements,
              such as <strong>buttons</strong>, <strong>links</strong>, and
              <strong>forms</strong>, can be accessed and operated using the
              keyboard.

                Using your keyboard, check that all interactive elements
                (buttons, links, or anything that can be interacted with) can be
                reached using the <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>arrow</kbd> keys. Can
                you navigate through the whole page with just the keyboard?

                through.
              </li>
              <li>
                The order in which you tab through the elements should be

              On the web, links enable users to navigate from one webpage to

              Therefore, it is essential to ensure that links are visible and

              information that the user will access by clicking on the link.
              This approach not only enhances web accessibility but also
              improves the overall user experience.

                Inspect a webpage link by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect"

            <h2>Form labels</h2>
            <p>
              Form labels have a significant impact on making web forms
              accessible and user-friendly. A label placed next to each input
              field clearly describes its purpose and guides users through the
              form-filling process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Properly labelled forms are crucial not only for usability but
              also for web accessibility. They ensure that all users can
              successfully complete forms, regardless of how they interact with
              a web page.
            </p>
            <h3>How to review</h3>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Make sure every <strong>input field</strong> has a
                <strong>label</strong> indicating the information users should
                enter.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you click on an input field to start typing or
                <strong>focus</strong> on it, check that the label doesn't
                disappear or get covered up. You should always be able to see
                the label.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>

              </li>
              <li>
                Inputs should not rely solely on placeholder text for labelling,
                as placeholders are not substitutes for labels and can pose
                accessibility issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                When an input field is focused, ensure the label does not
                obscure the input or disappear, which can disorient users.

            <h2>Touch targets</h2>
            <p>
              The term "touch target" refers to the specific area that a user
              needs to tap to activate an interactive element like buttons,
              links, or custom interactive widgets.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important that touch targets are appropriately sized to
              cater to users with mobility or vision impairments and to provide
              an optimal experience for users on mobile devices.
            </p>
            <h3>How to review</h3>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>

                <strong>Right-click</strong> on the image you want to check,
                select <strong>inspect,</strong> or
                <strong>inspect element</strong> (depending on the browser).
              </li>
              <li>
                While hovering over the an element with your cursor, you will
                get a preview, which will show the dimensions of the element.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure that the minimum size of any interactive element is at
                least <strong>44x44 CSS pixels</strong>. This size is
                recommended to provide a comfortable target for finger taps,
                reducing the risk of errors and making the site more accessible.
              </li>

            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It's important to provide sufficient spacing between touch
                targets to prevent accidental activations.
              </li>
              <li>
                For essential interactions, consider making touch targets larger
                than the minimum size. Larger targets are easier to use and can
                significantly enhance usability for many users.

                with elements on different screen sizes and resolutions.

            <h2>Responsive content</h2>
            <p>
              Many users rely on zooming in to read text, view images, and
              interact with page elements. A website that can be navigated and
              used easily at high zoom levels, without the need for horizontal
              scrolling, provides a better experience for these users.
            </p>
            <h3>How to review</h3>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Open your browser's settings. Look for the zoom option, which is
                typically available in the menu or settings panel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Increase the zoom level to <strong>400%</strong>. This simulates
                what content might look like to a user who needs content to be
                enlarged to see it more clearly.
              </li>
              <li>
                At a <strong>400%</strong> zoom, check if all the page content
                fits within the viewport and is usable without needing to scroll
                horizontally.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Exceptions to horizontal scrolling:</strong>
            While horizontal scrolling should generally be avoided, there are
            exceptions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Large tables that contain a lot of information may require
                horizontal scrolling to view all the data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Photos, maps, charts, and certain games that are designed to be
                wide may also necessitate horizontal scrolling.
              </li>
              <li>
                Interfaces with toolbars or panels that are an integral part of
                the navigation or functionality.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Using responsive design principles to ensure content reflows and
                adapts to various screen sizes and zoom levels. Use flexible
                layouts and scalable images to accommodate different viewing
                conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure that the text remains legible at high zoom levels. Avoid
                fixed font sizes in pixels; use relative units like ems or rems
                instead, which scale better when zoomed in.
              </li>
              <li>
                Test that all navigational elements, like
                <strong>menus</strong>, <strong>links</strong>, and
                <strong>buttons</strong>, are fully accessible and operable at
                increased zoom levels. Users should be able to access all parts
                of the site without difficulty.
              </li>
            </ul>

                When users zoom in on your website to see content clearly,
                ensure that they can scroll only up and down, not left and
                right. This makes it simpler for everyone to navigate your
                website and read its content, particularly for those who find it
                challenging to read small text.

              <div class="caption-text">
                If your website doesn't adjust automatically when users zoom in,
                they may need to scroll both horizontally and vertically to
                access all the content. This can be frustrating and make it hard
                for users to navigate your website and recall the information
                they need.
