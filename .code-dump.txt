        Before you start looking for accessibility issues, let's get set up with
        some tools.

        <p>
          To get started, this page is separated into two parts: automated
          testing and manual testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because some things are easier to check with a tool or
          extension. They save time and are more efficient when checking certain
          things. However, these tools can't cover everything and sometimes can
          miss critical issues, so we complement it with manual checks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we get started, we need to download a tool to run our automated
          tests. We will utilise aXe by Deque University. It's free and runs on
          your web browser. Go ahead and download it.
        </p>

          <span class="material-icons">north_east</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the steps to access and run the tool after installing it:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              First, open up your developer tools by using the
              <strong>(CMD + SHIFT + i)</strong> for mac or
              <strong>(WINDOWS + SHIFT + i)</strong> for windows. This will
              display all the code used to generate the web page. You can also
              <strong>(RIGHT-CLICK)</strong> anywhere on the screen and select
              <strong>"Inspect"</strong>.
            </p>
            <img
              src="assets/inspect.png"
              alt="Screenshot of how to open developer tools"
              class="responsive-image"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Next, click on the little submenu located in the top right corner
              of the page and select the aXe tool from the list.
            </p>
            <img
              src="assets/run-tool.png"
              alt="Screenshot of how to open developer tools"
              class="responsive-image"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Click on the "Scan page" button and wait for it to complete the
              scan. Any issues detected will be displayed at the bottom of the
              page.
            </p>
            <img
              src="assets/scan.png"
              alt="Screenshot of how to open developer tools"
              class="responsive-image"
            />
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Although it may appear overwhelming if lots of issues appear, we will
          go through key issues to look out for below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now you know how to run the aXe extension let's continue to the
          Automated testing.

            Check the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Images that convey information unavailable through other content
                should have an alt tag.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Meaningful:
                    <code>Alt="What gets read goes here"</code>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Images that provide no information, such as illustrations, must
                be coded as decorative.
                <ul>
                  <li>Decorative: <code>Alt=""</code></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The rule of thumb used to determine whether an image is
                informative is to remove it from the screen: if I am missing
                information because the image is gone, then it means the image
                is informative and needs alt text.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check any images with alt text are descriptive and relevant.
                This requires some manual intervention, but we want to ensure
                alt text is accurate.

            It can be difficult for individuals who are visually impaired to
            interpret images. Correct markup and good text alternatives make
            them accessible to everyone. Actual text is better than images of
            text because it can be adjusted for legibility.

            Heading levels help convey the relative importance of headings on a
            webpage. People with good eyesight can distinguish the importance of
            a heading by its visual appearance, with higher-level headings
            generally having greater visual prominence than lower-level ones.
            <br />
            On the other hand, users of assistive technology rely on
            programmatic cues to perceive heading levels.

          This page has four points to review. We will go through them one by

            <strong>Keyboard navigation:</strong>
            <ul>
              Check that all interactive elements (buttons, links, or anything
              that can be interacted with) can be reached using the tab and
              arrow keys. Can you navigate through the whole page with just the
              keyboard?
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus indicators:</strong>
            <ul>
              Make sure all interactive elements have a visual indicator when in
              focus. This is typically a border or colour change when tabbed
              through. See image below for example.
            </ul>
          </li>

          />
          <li>
            <strong>Tab order:</strong>
            <ul>
              As you tab through your page, check the order is consistent with
              the visual, logical order. Does the order in which you tabbed
              follow a similar order in how you would read the content on the
              page?
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Keyboard traps:</strong>
            <ul>
              Keyboard traps are when you tab into an element with no way out.
              Commonly found with Date pickers and modals that take over the
              focus. Just double-check that you can tab through the whole page
              without getting trapped.
            </ul>

          <p class="card-content">
            It's important for web apps to let users navigate through all
            interactive components using a keyboard. If users can't access these
            components, they won't be able to use the app. Keyboard navigation
            is especially critical for people with disabilities such as
            blindness, low vision, or hand tremors who rely on it to access
            these elements.

            If a link leads to a document or web page, the name is of the page

          </li>
          <li>
            For hyperlinks, it is essential to use unique text for each link
            that leads to a different destination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the same link text for all the links that lead to the same

            Links that open new tabs should show an external icon and announce
            that it will open a new window. I haven't gone into
            <a href="">ARIA</a> in this page, but we use ARIA to let screen
            reader users know the link will open a new window like this.

            It is important for users to understand the purpose of a link before
            deciding whether to follow it. When the text of the link is unclear,
            sighted users can use the context around it to get an idea of what
            it means. Similarly, assistive technologies can help non-sighted
            users by providing them with the link's related context.

            pose accessibility issues.

            When an input field is focused, ensure the label does not obscure

            Clear form labels are vital for all users to fill out forms
            correctly. Labels give sighted users a visual cue connecting text to
            input fields. For those with assistive technology, labels provide
            necessary context for each input. This ensures all users can
            interact with forms effectively, reducing errors. Clear labels are
            also essential for speech recognition software users to control form
            elements with voice commands.
